# multi_search_dorks.sh

**multi_search_dorks.sh** is a Bash script that automates the process of finding files in a given domain using Google. It supports one or more file extensions, such as `.pdf`, `.doc`, `.docx`, `.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.ppt`, and `.pptx`. This can be useful for OSINT, security audits, and general file discovery.

## Features

- Specify a single file extension or search for multiple common extensions at once using `all`.
- Utilizes Google as the search engine, fetching up to 100 results (first page) for each extension.
- Consolidates links in a single output file, removing duplicates.
- Straightforward and requires only minimal dependencies.

## Usage

```bash
./multi_search_dorks.sh <domain> <extension|all>
